Goal: to engage and delight!

Path: 

Oh my! I didn't expect company so soon! Hello, my name is Alex, it's a pleasure to meet you. Please, have a look around, I'm particularly fond of the [[endeavors/index|Endeavors]] section where you'll find some of my works. Otherwise, there are many of my own musings spread across these pages... for better or worse.

This might be a strange portfolio to stumble upon, but it's as much for you as it is for me. These pages serve as my public facing notes... and I take a lot of them! When I was in high school I was elected secretary for our National Honors Society. I don't think I understood at that time why I was secretary as opposed to president, but over the years, and particularly as I evolved as the secretary on the Board of Directors in the building I reside; I've realized I'm a decent curator. I make connections between disparate ideas and categorize/organize systematically. In fact, if we peered through my google drive you'd see an interesting structure. A directory called `places` lists items such as umd (University of Maryland) and capital-one. These serve as memory cornerstones in my mind. I document potentially mundane details like food staples I had in college... That dry whole wheat bread with plain Greek yogurt spread, topped with steel cut oats and raisins while sitting at my desk in the Prince Frederick dormitories. I've been told, "if it ain't written, it's rotten." A nod at our inability to memorize. At least for myself, associations are influential, words *and* their absence have meaning, and naming is important (albeit difficult). If we structure a thought correctly, categorize and store it appropriately, it might be remembered far after we're gone...
