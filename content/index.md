Goal: Establish systems that rejuvenate and fulfill.

Path: Systematically connect us with sources of awe, joy, and challenge.

Hooray, you've stumbled upon Alexander (Alex) Medeiros' portfolio! This site serves as a public-facing chronicle of my projects, journal entries, and associations.

You'll find two main ways to navigate. First, use the `Tree View` by toggling the "hamburger" icon in the top-left. Second, use the `Graph View` located on the bottom of each page. The `Tree View` is how the underlying files are organized and is a decent starting point while the `Graph View` provides some spatial awareness to each page and how it may connect to others. In the future I intend to implement a `Chronological View` which will depict each of the entries on a timeline.

So, please, have a look around, I'm particularly fond of the [[endeavors/index|Endeavors]] section where you'll find some of my works. Or, for a consolidated view of my experiences, check out my [[2_resume|Resume]].

If we structure a thought correctly, categorize and store it appropriately, it might be remembered far after we're gone.
