My goal: To engage and delight

My path: Match us with our personal sources of awe and joy

Oh my! I didn't expect company so soon! Hello, my name is Alex, it's a pleasure to meet you. Please, have a look around, I'm particularly fond of the [[endeavors/index|Endeavors]] section where you'll find some of my works. Otherwise, there are many of my own musings spread across these pages... for better or worse.

This might be a strange portfolio to stumble upon, but it's as much for you as it is for me. These pages serve as my public facing notes... and I take a lot of them! When I was in high school, I was elected secretary for our National Honors Society. I don't think I understood, at that time, why I was secretary as opposed to president, but over the years, and particularly as I evolved as the secretary on the Board of Directors in the building I reside; I've realized I'm a decent curator. I make connections between disparate ideas and categorize/organize systematically. In fact, if we peered through my google drive you'd see an interesting structure. A directory called `places` lists items such as umd (University of Maryland) and capital-one. These serve as memory cornerstones because of the number of times we reference . I've been told, "if it ain't written, it's rotten." A nod at our inability to memorize. Aside from keeping memories, notes are important for tying ideas together while not keeping the full content of the notes in our heads at once.

Associations are influential, words *and* their absence have meaning, and naming is important (albeit difficult). If we structure a thought correctly, categorize and store it appropriately, it might be remembered far after we're gone...
