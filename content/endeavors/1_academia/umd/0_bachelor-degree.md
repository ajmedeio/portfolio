In 2017, I graduated from the University of Maryland with Honors from Design Cultures & Creativity as a Bachelor of Science in Physics & Computer Science.

It's tough... to see four years of sleep deprivation and proud work reduced to a single sentence. I must have solved hundreds of equations, written hundreds of pages, and hundreds of programs. I made life-long friends and blundered a relationship. I researched, I cried, I laughed, I napped, I invented (who doesn't over the course of four years?). There were so many tasks, tests, and missed alarms. It was a whirlwind and I'd advise no one to follow the same path, but I am happy I'm here. I'd like to thank all the classmates for entertaining my many questions, the professors that enjoyed me, and the friends that supported me. I wouldn't have traversed this far without them.
