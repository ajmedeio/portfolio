Disclaimer: I apologize there's no playback controls! I made this as an extra honors assignment in my Introduction to Electricity & Magnetism class. As an honors student, we were responsible for extra assignments due at the end of the year. This was one of those assignments.


To explain relativistic electricity and magnetism we need a little prior knowledge of relativity. First, let's discuss length contraction:

Second, an introduction to time-dilation:

Now, we can start observing a neutral wire:
