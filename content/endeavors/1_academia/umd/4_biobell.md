The Biobell

The Biobell is finally here! The modern medical doctor is a thing of the past. The bell has been proven in several test subjects that it can be the all-in-one solution to many of the tools we use to track our health. It was first prescribed to a unique patient diagnosed with diabetes and chronic depression. In other words, this patient struggled through a snow-ball effect of conditions which simply piled on top of each other and resulted in obesity, depression, and a loss of motivation. When probing into why this person had been an athlete in grade school and an apathetic subject in adulthood, many questions had to be asked which caused the doctor to administer a small dosage of serotonin when waking up and melatonin when going to bed for a month. Since the subject was diabetic, they were also taking insulin shots, and it wasn’t an enormous inconvenience or new experience to take these supplemental shots. Eventually we crafted a device that worked all day to give smaller, but constant doses of all three serotonin, melatonin, and insulin. After the month concluded the patient reported increased energy and motivation, and had started playing video games in their free time. Although it wasn’t physical exercise, it was a huge improvement over eating and watching sitcoms after work every night. Over the course of the next year, the patient had lost 20 pounds of weight and seen increased performance at work. The patient was in an overall better state of health than before with the administration of small daily doses of natural neurotransmitters. This was the inspiration of the Biobell. We started small clinical trials for unhealthy young males to see the effects of both these chemicals on subjects over the course of 3 years. All subjects reported increased energy and motivation and we instantly saw a market! The first prototype of the Biobell combined several devices including a blood sugar sensor, a heartbeat sensor, cholesterol level tracker, and a sensor for serotonin and melatonin. Each of the sensors was an individual gadget that was worn on the waist like a utility belt. Each device connected through a single intravenous node, kept track of the specified values, and administered whatever chemical the user required. Future iterations included cortisol, testosterone, and estrogen sensors, but by this time the patients had a full waist belt of trackers which needed some trimming down. The first step combined the hormone sensors and neurotransmitter sensors in separate complete devices which allowed consumers to pick and choose which device they actually needed. After that, we saw more varying effects when the node was placed on different regions of the body. So we started testing different node sites and found the spinal column to be the most active region with regards to administering the chemicals. The first prototype of the public product had finally came to fruition and only required a doctor’s prescription.

Introduction of the Biobell

Your phone always talked to your friends, your parents, your profiles, and even your home; but there’s one thing your phone never talked to; your body. The advent of the Biobell will keep us healthy and safe for decades to come.

The Biobell is a product placed right under the second vertebrae, the axis. It’s installed in one of the several Biobell stores through a harmless and delicate surgery. The installation, just over an hour, essentially sets up the base of the bell. The base is the only piece touching your body, while the actual bell is a modular part that can be upgraded, exchanged, or removed at any time by simply detaching the bell and inserting another. This is one of the great features of the Biobell, whether you’re diabetic, anemic, elderly, or otherwise healthy, there’s a Biobell specifically for you which stays alert for any deficiencies your body has.

First Impressions

There were many people hesitant of getting the first iteration of the Biobell, as it was seemingly invasive, but on the contrary, it was detecting deficiencies in hundreds of thousands on its first day of release. It’s an exciting time to be alive when the devices we’ve crafted can track everything from insulin to iron levels and communicate through intuitive graphs and even automatically control specified levels.

50 years later

The Biobell has become a ubiquitous piece of the human condition. Babies have the Biobell installed within months of being born and newer technology has been created that grows with the body. The new bell can now connect to the brain stem and send signals back and forth. Telepathy is now common place with the bell connecting to the world-wide Wi-Fi. Context no longer has control over the world around you, you’re in control! The stormy weather will no longer force you to hit the snooze button. We naturally wake up because the bell releases the right levels of serotonin at the right time. That myth about eight hours of sleep is far in the past. With the data collected through the ubiquity of the Biobell, vast exploration has occurred in biomedical fields and life-altering advances have been discovered. Going to sleep is becoming less and less meaningful as scientists explore the human body and find hacks to resolve drowsiness and exhaustion. Remember feeling fatigue after that thanksgiving dinner? No longer is it an issue to remain alert for days at a time and feel better than ever before because the body is receiving the proper nutrients and hormones to stay healthy. Back in the day, people had pent-up cortisol which triggered large fat stores, but no longer, there are anti-serums to counter its effects and can be released automatically if the user desires such intervention. 

Heart disease was the number one killer in the United States a century ago, but that is far in the past as the Biobell can release dopamine to motivate the user to exercise. Training the brain with dopamine has been one of the most exciting advances. Any task that seemed displeasing is now a dopamine hit away from being an exciting adventure. Apart from increased exercise, cholesterol levels are being checked in real-time and can be controlled even after the user ate bacon and eggs for breakfast.

As with all technology, there are cons to advancement. As previously stated, pure dopamine can be used to motivate and serotonin can be used to awaken us, but since we started synthesizing these drugs with ease, some of humanity has obviously taken advantage of the drugs. Regulation has seemed impossible as people figure out new ways to make the chemicals and since the Biobell is modular, it is fairly easy to craft a dummy module and fill it with whatever one desires. At first, the government tried to regulate the Biobells by requiring them to have a connection at all times. This connection sent the types of chemicals being administered and statistics on every person, but the hackers came out with solutions to disable the connection and still provide the same benefits as the original system. What we’ve decided here at the Biobell labs is we’ll let natural selection take over. If users decide they want to take dopamine hits all day, so be it. The users with self-control will ultimately become the users who dominate the bell’s market, and as our parents always told us, too much of a good thing is terrible for you. The same goes with these chemicals. Surprisingly, there has been a large enough consumer-base that is responsible about the drugs to delay any reason for banning it entirely, but between you and I, I fear the future uses of the Bell…
