Today we're going to discuss some thoughts and opinions on story points.

I still have to read more on story points and I've grabbed the Scrum Mastery book by Geoff Watts which I'll listen to throughout next week.

Anyway, here are my opinions. I believe story points have a way of creating pressure and stress for developers who can't finish tasks as fast as others.

When individuals are experiencing pain or duress, their thoughts contain defensive ideals. A worried state can manifest as feelings of pressure to accomplish tasks on time,
unnecessary comparison to others which only act to diminish one's effectiveness, and ultimately, lower quality output.

Perhaps fortunately or by design, happy people produce the highest quality work for the longest period of time [1](). My primary goal is to relieve your negativities. 
I have full faith that after release of thorns, everything we need continues effortlessly.
