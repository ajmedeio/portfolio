**Organization:** Tower Villas Council of Co-Owners<br/>
**Position:** Director & Secretary on Board of Directors<br/>
**Time and Place:** January 2022 â€“ Present | Arlington, VA
- **What:** Elected by the residents into the Tower Villas (~260-unit condo building) Board of Directors to advise and decide on critical matters to the building and community at large.
- **How:** Every month the board meets to rule on motions brought forth by committees such as Building & Grounds, Finance, Social, and Technology.
- **Impact:** Our board has addressed problems as seemingly trivial as the color of trim in the hallways to those of potentially catastrophic proportions, e.g. a bow in the foundational concrete slabs of the building.
