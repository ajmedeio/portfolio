Tower Villas Council of Co-Owners | Secretary of Board of Directors | Arlington, VA January 2022 â€“ Present
- Elected by the residents into the Tower Villas (~260-unit condo building) Board of Directors to advise and decide on critical matters to the building and community at large.
- Every month the board meets to rule on motions brought forth by committees such as Building & Grounds, Finance, Social, and Technology.
- Our cohort solved issues of varying scale. From one of potentially catastrophic proportions, a bow in the foundational concrete slabs of the building; to issues as seemingly trivial as what color to use for the trim of the hallways.
