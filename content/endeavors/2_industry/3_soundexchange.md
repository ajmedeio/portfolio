- Member of the “distribution processing” team which managed royalty distribution from providers such as Spotify to respective artists.
- Implemented an accounting system that ingested billions of rows of data (play data for songs, podcasts, etc) per month and
built a mapping of artists to their payout amount.
- Our new accounting platform reduced processing time from several days to several hours. This was accomplished by building on more modern design principles such as append-only storage and highly horizontally scaled infrastructure.
