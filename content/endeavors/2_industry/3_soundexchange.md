**Tech Stack:** Java | Spring | Angular | Python | Bash | PostgreSQL | Jenkins CI/CD | Docker | AWS ECS
- **What:** Member of the “distribution processing” team which managed royalty distribution from providers such as Spotify to respective artists.
- **How:** Implemented an accounting system that ingested billions of rows of data (play data for songs, podcasts, etc) per month and built a mapping of artists to their payout amount.
- **Impact:** Our new accounting platform reduced processing time from several days to several hours. This was accomplished by building on more modern design principles such as append-only storage and highly horizontally scaled infrastructure.
