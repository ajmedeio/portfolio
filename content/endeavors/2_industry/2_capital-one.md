**Position:** Lead Senior Software Engineer<br/>
**Time and Place:** May 2019 – September 2020 | McLean, VA<br/>
**Tech Stack:** Python | XBRL | Jenkins CI/CD | Docker | AWS Lambda<br/>
- **What:** Designed and built a prototypical ATM that would serve as the foundation for future hardware products at Capital One.
- **How:** Our team was the hub of many spokes where we integrated work from various teams across hardware, identity & account management, security (both physical & virtual), and money movement. We weaved together the various efforts with hardware drivers, backend APIs, and our frontend webapp. I was personally responsible for scheduling meetings with the majority of technical resources including preparation of architecture & sequence diagrams, defense of our security model, and interfacing with money movement.
- **Impact:** Our prototypical Cashier’s Check Kiosk was deployed into a Capital One location just before the COVID-19 pandemic. The pandemic resulted in a re-org where I was pulled onto our sister team as their tech lead.
