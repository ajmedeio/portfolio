Aside from [[4_jhu-apl|JHU: APL]] and my startup [[4_project-del|Project Del]], FINRA was my first employer out of undergrad. Around the time the startup pittered out, I created my <a href="https://linkedin.com/in/ajmedeio" target="_blank">LinkedIn profile</a> and started receiving recruiter messages. A contracting company connected me with FINRA and the interviews started. I was young and perhaps a tad arrogant, but we made it through! One of my in-person interviews was with a Program Manager and she saw I had a double major in physics and computer science. She asked, "Do you believe in the many-worlds theory?" I responded, "We definitely didn't study it in undergrad, but I've watched a lot of documentaries on the different interpretations of quantum theory and I'm not entirely convinced yet." We went back-and-forth dicussing its possibilities. Two hours later I had my offer!
