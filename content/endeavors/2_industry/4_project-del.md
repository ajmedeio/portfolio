- Project Del’s mission was to automate the mundane to create more time for those we love. It all started at the metaphorical beginning of our day, with a cup of coffee.
- Developed a prototype smart coffee maker that automated the coffee-making process for 1-2 weeks with little human intervention.
- Users had the ability to finely adjust all coffee-making parameters including water temperature and coffee ground size. Made possible by designing and implementing an array of electronic sensors such as digital thermometers.
- Led our team through 3D modeling, embedded/application development, and external relationships until we ultimately dissolved under time constraints.
