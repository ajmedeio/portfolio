**Position:** Startup Founder & Full-stack IoT Software Engineer<br/>
**Time and Place:** May 2017 – May 2018 | Leesburg, VA<br/>
**Tech Stack:** Raspberry-Pi | C | Java | Typescript | CAD (Fusion 360) | Android | Angular | Firebase
- **Why:** Project Del’s mission was to automate the mundane to create more time for those we love. It all started at the metaphorical beginning of our day, with a cup of coffee.
- **What:** Developed a prototype smart coffee maker that automated the coffee-making process for up to two weeks with little human intervention.
- **How:** By designing and implementing an array of electronic sensors such as digital thermometers to programmatically monitor all coffee making parameters including grind size, water temperature, water level, waste level, and bean level.
- **Impact:** Led our team through 3D modeling, embedded/application programming, and maintenance of external relationships until we finished our prototype and ultimately dissolved under monetary constraints.
