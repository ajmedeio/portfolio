- Taught a 24-week software engineering bootcamp where my students started with zero experience. The goal was to have them ready for industry by the end of their class. I’m excited to say there were no dropouts, all my students passed, and about half of them found software engineering jobs! Following is the feedback I received as an instructor:
	- “Alex, Sebastian, and Ethan went above and beyond to help us with our group projects and even took their own unpaid time to make sure we were able to complete our assignments. Amazing instructors”
	- “I really can't thank you enough for everything you've done for us all throughout the class. Being able to see the passion you exude while teaching is a huge reason as to why I've fallen in love with this thing that I knew nothing about 6 months ago, and I am so grateful for that. Thank you again for everything…”
- Nominated for Best Instructor of the Year
