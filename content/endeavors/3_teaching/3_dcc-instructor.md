Sophomore year of undergrad I was asked to instruct a 6 hour workshop on anything I desired. I taught a class of 15 freshman to build an Android application that displayed the recent weather based on current GPS location. This required deep familiarity with the Android Development Kit and an ability to debug problems across each student's environment. 14 of the 15 students walked away from the class with a working weather application!
