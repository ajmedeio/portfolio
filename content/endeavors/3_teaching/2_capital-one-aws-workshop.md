Capital One had a program called TDP (Technical Development Program) that hired and trained STEM related majors (non computer science) in software engineering. After an initial bootcamp they were rotated into teams that accepted them. I initiated a workshop that met every Tuesday and prepped TDPs for their AWS Associate Architect Certification exam.

The group was usually about half-a-dozen TDPs and fluctuated each semester as they rotated to different teams. It was a soft requirement that TDPs complete their certification which created motivation while we went through the curriculum developed by <a href="https://www.pluralsight.com/cloud-guru" target="_blank">A Cloud Guru</a>.
