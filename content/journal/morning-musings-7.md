Dear Journal,

Today is a good day. Although I still need to stretch to agree with that statement... I think? Maybe not. Remember what Jane told me - if a pregnant woman needed to use the bathroom, we would encourage them to go. If a madman needs to stretch... we should encourage them to do so...

Yesterday, Jane said, Christiana is connected to Rita. I made Christiana an extension of Rita.

...Signs are a pathetic means to restrict a room. YOU THINK A SIGN WILL STOP ME?! I CANâ€™T EVEN READ! HAHAHA.

Sorry, I'm sort of tired. It's been a long month. I finished my first semester in grad school!
