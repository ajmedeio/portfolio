title: Journal

Within the journal, I store thoughts I'm less comfortable sharing in formal contexts. Ideas that might make others uncomfortable, like, "what if we're in a simulation," kinda ideas. Within these pages you'll find feelings that I want to be heard, but terribly scared to share in a conversation.
