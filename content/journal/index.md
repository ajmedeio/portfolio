Spending a life studying oneself is a life well lived...

Within my journal, I store thoughts I'm less comfortable sharing in formal contexts. Ideas that might make others uncomfortable, like, "what if we're in a simulation," kinda ideas. Within these pages you'll find feelings I want heard, but perhaps scared to share in conversation. Don't take anything in these pages seriously. If I've used names, they are probably fake names to protect the identity of those individuals, however, I will remain consistent across entries (i.e. if I use a name for someone, I will use that same name in other entries). I apologize if some thoughts offend... again, these writings are personal in nature and sometimes we're hurt and that can turn thoughts into daggers. The reason I'm publishing these entries is to follow open source ideals. I believe airing the dirty laundry, so-to-speak, might help others explore difficult inner worries and anxieties. Although my LinkedIn might be clean, there are feelings beneath the surface, far more intense than a resume indicates. There are memories and corresponding fears that drive decisions and opinions. We need to be aware of them to honor them properly. We need to acknowledge them to reconcile them. I hope my entries give some relief from the posts that tout new positions, application acceptances, or other achievements. There is more to this world than we've made. So, please, give life a stay.
