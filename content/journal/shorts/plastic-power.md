These days, plastic is power

Building up a tower of debt that's unmet

Trillions of transactions we'll certainly regret

Damn it, this ain't a game of Russian roulette

Previous gen placed us all on a bet

That we would rise up, fix all that's unkept



It's okay Mom and Dad

Our debt might be bad

You might be responding, "oh, gosh, oh, egad!"

But trust me the new gen is pretty damn rad

We'll figure it out together

Get rid of this weight forever
