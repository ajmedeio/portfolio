Got a world in my head

Let me climb into bed

So I can explore this instead

What's out there is dull, dying, and dead

In here I have fires that stretch to the skies and all these fumpin fireflies

Neon that glows across the mossy floors and humans unafraid to cross a boundary of boars

Out there you're all so afraid of being slayed and being carted away

This life is more than you've made

Come one, come all, let's give it a stay

Stop fearing for your life and finally play

Put your chin up, I promise it'll pay

Put a smile cross your face, let's give life a taste!

Apologies, pain is just part of this game

I swear you'll recover it's all just the same

As happiness, joy, and all of the fame

Time will wither all of your tears

Our ancestors certainly threw a couple of spears 

So I understand, covering our rears

But trust me this world was made to conquer those fears
