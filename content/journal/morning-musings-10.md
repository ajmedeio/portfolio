Dear Journal,

I think I need to write my childhood down. Put it to paper.

Specifically, the parts including Rita. Do I want to put her to rest or reanimate her through me?

Do I need to write about all the memories I have of her?

What should I do to move forward?

Somehow writing all the memories feels like it might move me backwards, but maybe I need to
write it to understand and deal with it?

Would understanding anything help me?

Sincerely,\
Alex
