Dear Journal,

I know, why, all the sudden, am I writing to you on a regular basis...
I'm not entirely certain myself, but I appreciate the time. I'm watching a video on the youtube channel, "The School of Life,"
brain child of Alain de Botton, "5 Questions to Ask Yourself Every Evening."

1. What am I really worried about?
    1. We often use one worry to shield us from another. We worry about money to not worry about death.
2. What am I presently sad about?
    1. We often carry ourselves with courage and competence, but a number of things hurt us everyday.
3. Who has annoyed me and how?
    1. This often arises at the end of the day and we need to vent about them.
4. What does my body want?
    1. Much of what we feel, and do not process, manifests in our body.
    1. What has our body been unfairly burdened with?
5. What is still lovely?
    1. These are often quite small but fortify us against despair. We need to make a conscious effort to squeeze joy out of daily elements.

Sincerely,\
Alex
