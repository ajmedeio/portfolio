Dear Journal,

I read ![[Morning Musings 8]] to Jane today. What a difficult read... Oh, Rita. I hate you? Hahahaha, that feels better...

Damn it, I loved you so much and I didn't even know. Hating is easier than losing.

Thank you for being my sister. You were really incredible at what you did.

I hope I can honor your memory in a way that helps me... Is that possible? Maybe I'll start doing more for Rita's Closet.

Sincerely,\
Alex
