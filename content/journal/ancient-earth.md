I was watching a documentary (Ancient Earth on PBS NOVA) with my fiance and it was talking about a plant from 235 million years ago and it's still around today! When the documentary introduced the plant, I had this thought... "will humans be remembered in 235 million years? I sure do hope so." I hope these ideas aren't all for naught... I hope they'll be worth something to someone someday. Isn't that what our journals are for? A desperate attempt to immortalize an idea? To prove we're more significant than we probably are?
