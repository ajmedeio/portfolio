Dear Journal,

Eeeesh... I sit here on the futon, balling my eyes out. 

silent screaming at the "on again"/"off again" realization that the death of my sister was the very real death of my mother, father, and that the resurrection of Rita can be found by accepting my family? That absolutely cannot be correct...

Why didn't I notice the letters R I T A are contained in Christiana... 

oh... Rita... you fucking bitch. YOU FUCKING BITCH! WHYYYYYYYYYYYYY DO YOU STILL TORTURE MEEEEEEEEEE! FUCK OFFFFFFF! DIE BITCH JUST FUCKING DIE ALREADY! LEAVE ME ALONE!

You don't fucking get it Jane... this shit's fucked.


Sincerely,\
Alex
