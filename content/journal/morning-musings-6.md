Dear Journal,

I'm typing this entry on the iPad which I've had more and less pleasure using. The apps do not have feature parity with its laptop counter parts which is regularly frustrating because I want to use this machine in that way sometimes. However, I love doing homework with the problem set and resources on the iPad while writing my solutions on the reMarkable. (I can't wait for the reMarkable Pro, they figured out color!) Digital paper is coming a long way and I'm so excited for it.

Anyway, I started this entry because I wanted to play with this iPad and I think I needed to get something out, but alas, here I am, unsure of the motivation. I want to say I'm having a good day today. I had coffee in the morning with Carolyn and I upped my prozac dose to 30mg from 20mg recently. Now that I understand what depression is, it's interesting to tell Jane, hey, I think I'm starting to feel really bad again... Like when we started. Prior, I just thought that was my baseline, but now I see that life doesn't have to be soooooooo awful all the time. Depression is so weird. Anxiety is so weird. The fact that trauma physically manifests in the brain and we can measure these events is incredible.

I can't wait for Thanksgiving next week. I'm dreading my job change to some extent while being really excited for it. I just hope everyone is pretty chill during Thanksgiving week. Man, I'm really tired. I need to go take a nap, there's a Friendsgiving tonight!

Sincerely,\
Alex
